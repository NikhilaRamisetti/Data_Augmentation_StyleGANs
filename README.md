# Data_Augmentation_StyleGANs

In one of my repositories I have already trained a vanilla GAN model(please refer to GAN for detail), since 2016 after invention of GAN's lot of its variants were created. But, one that seemed very interseting to me and which was a significant breakthrough was "Style GANs".

```
StyleGAN is a GAN variant that's "better" than traditional GANs by being "style-accurate."
```

StyleGAN is an advanced GAN variant that excels in producing high-quality, customizable, and diverse images. Its ability to disentangle and control specific image attributes and its architectural enhancements make it a powerful tool for various applications, including art, entertainment, fashion, and more.

It is known for:
* High-Quality Image Generation
* Controlled Image Synthesis
* Smooth Interpolation
* No Mode Collapse
* Progressive Growing
* Mapping Networks
* Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN)
* Multi-Resolution Architectures
* State-of-the-Art Image Synthesis
* Transfer Learning

In this repository we will be using pre-trained
