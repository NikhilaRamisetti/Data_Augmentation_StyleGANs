# Data_Augmentation_StyleGANs

In one of my repositories I have already trained a vanilla GAN model(please refer to GAN for detail), since 2016 after invention of GAN's lot of its variants were created. But, one that seemed very interseting to me was "Style GANs".

```
*** StyleGAN is a GAN variant that's "better" than traditional GANs by being "style-accurate." ***
```
